## Basic code to find ODD or EVEN number

#Get user input
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))

#Check remainder
remainder = number % 2

if remainder == 0:
   print(f"The number is even number with remainder: {remainder}")
else: 
   print(f"The number is odd number with remainder: {remainder}")
